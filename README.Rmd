# plumber-example

This repository demonstrates how to set up a `{plumber}` Application Programming Interface (API),
then call that API in R.

Find the `{plumber}` documentation here: https://www.rplumber.io/index.html

## Requirements
- R >= 4.1(for steps 1 - 4, Creation).
- Docker Desktop (for steps 5 - 9, Dockerization).
- A Digital Ocean account, or access to the FR account (for steps 9 - 21, Deployment).

## Instructions

To set up a `{plumber}` API take the following steps:

### Creation
1. Place the functions you wish to expose via an API in a file, usually in the /R directory, see the example /R/functions.R file.
2. Create a plumber.R file, see the example file (/plumber.R) containing a single GET endpoint.
3. Test the API works locally by running `plumber::pr("plumber.R") |> plumber::pr_run(port = 8000)`. This should open a window with automatically generated API documentation, available at http://localhost:8000/__docs__/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/__docs__/.

### Dockerization
4. Install the `{renv}` R package, and create a renv.lock file with `renv::init()`, this file captures all of the project dependencies.
5. To deploy the app first create a file named "Dockerfile" with no file extension, see example /Dockerfile.
6. Open a terminal in the working directory of your repository, in RStudio simply click on the terminal tab.
7. Build a Docker image with `docker build --no-cache -t registry.digitalocean.com/forestresearch/plumber-example:v0.1 .`
8. Check the Docker image runs locally by running `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --privileged=true --name plumber-example registry.digitalocean.com/forestresearch/plumber-example:v0.1`, then navigate to the documentation as described above.
9. Once satisfied that the Docker instance is running as expected stop and remove the instance with `docker rm -f plumber-example`.

### Deployment
10. Log into a container registry, e.g. the Digital Ocean container registry using `docker login registry.digitalocean.com`. You will be prompted to enter a user and password when logging in for the first time, you should paste in a key which should be created here https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api, after logging in to Digital Ocean.
11. Push your Docker image to a container registry using `docker push registry.digitalocean.com/forestresearch/plumber-example:v0.1`.
12. Enter the server you wish to deploy the API on, e.g. a Digital Ocean droplet, through either SSH or opening the console through the Droplets web page.
13. In the server check Docker is installed with `docker info`, if it is not installed install docker following the steps here (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04). Usually it is preferable to skip this step by creating a Digital Ocean droplet with Docker pre-installed.
14. Log into the container registry from the server as above with `docker login registry.digitalocean.com`.
15. Pull your docker image into the server with `docker pull registry.digitalocean.com/forestresearch/plumber-example:v0.1`.
16. Check the image has been pulled with `docker images`.
17. Deploy your API run your docker image with `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --privileged=true --name plumber-example registry.digitalocean.com/forestresearch/plumber-example:v0.1`
18. Check the status of the docker instance with `docker ps -a`
19. If your Docker instance has exited inspect the container logs with `docker logs plumber-example`.
20. You can explore an running Docker instance with `docker exec -it plumber-example bash`, exit the instance with `exit`.
21. There you may perform tasks such as checking all the required files are present with `ls -lsa` etc.

Alternatively a `{plumber}` API may be deployed using a one-click solution such as Posit Connect.

## Calling the API in R

To call the API locally first run the Docker container with `docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --privileged=true --name plumber-example registry.digitalocean.com/forestresearch/plumber-example:v0.1`.

Then use the following code:

```
api_url <- "http://127.0.0.1:8000/exampleEndPoint"

responseRaw <- httr::GET(url = api_url, query = list(name = "Henry", age = "60"))

responseContent <- httr::content(responseRaw)

responseContent

# If the response is in JSON format, rather than the simple unboxed response
# in this example, use this additional code to unpack the response:
# response <- jsonlite::fromJSON(responseContent)
```

If the API is deployed non-locally, simply replace the URL.
