# plumber-example

This repository demonstrates how to set up a `{plumber}` Application Programming Interface (API) in the minimum number of steps.

## Requirements
- R
- Docker Desktop

## Instructions

To set up a `{plumber}` API take the following steps:

1. Place the functions you wish to expose via an API in a file, usually in the /R directory, see the example /R/functions.R file.
2. Create a plumber.R file, see the example file (/plumber.R).
3. Test the API works locally by running `plumber::pr("plumber.R") |> plumber::pr_run(port = 8000)`. This should open a window with automatically generated API documentation, available at http://localhost:8000/__docs__/ or http://127.0.0.1:8000/__docs__/.
4. To deploy the app first create a file named "Dockerfile" with no file extenstion, see example /Dockerfile.
6.
